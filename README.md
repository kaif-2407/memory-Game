This project is an interactive memory card game built using React and Tailwind CSS, where players reveal hidden numbers by clicking on cards. The game uses a grid-based layout to display cards in a clean and modern glass-style design. When a card is clicked, it reveals its number, creating a realistic memory-game experience instead of a simple show-and-hide effect.
 Tailwind CSS is used extensively to handle layout, spacing, animations, and responsiveness without writing custom CSS files. The project focuses on building interactive UI behavior, handling user clicks correctly, and maintaining a clean component structure.

This project was created as a hands-on practice to improve understanding of React state management, CSS Grid layouts, and animation techniques. It represents a practical frontend project that combines logic, animations, and responsive design in a single application.
